# Solving the Graph Coloring Problem and Sudoku Application with Linear Programming Algorithms
  
  The graph coloring problem (finding the chromatic number) is a common problem in Management Science with applications including scheduling optimization, timetabling, assignment problems, etc. 
  
__Definition 1:__ A `coloring` of an undirected graph G consists of assigning a number (or a color) to each node, with the restriction that any two nodes that have an edge in between cannot be assigned the same number (or color).

__Definition 2:__ The `chromatic number` of a graph is k âˆˆ N if there exists a coloring that uses k colors, but there is no coloring that uses less than k colors. Thus, the chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed to have a coloring of a graph.

The python 3.0 script [GraphColoringLP.py](https://github.com/tpawelski/graph-coloring-lp/blob/master/GraphColoringLP.py), uses the `PuLP` library in python to set up and solve the graph coloring problem as an integer linear program. The program finds the chromatic number of the graph represented as a list of edges in [edges.dat](https://github.com/tpawelski/graph-coloring-lp/blob/master/edges.dat).

Next, a linear programming formulation, based on the graph coloring approach discussed above, is used to find the optimal solution to the Sudoku puzzle shown in [SudokuPuzzle.png](https://github.com/tpawelski/graph-coloring-lp/blob/master/SudokuPuzzle.png). The script [Sudoku.py](https://github.com/tpawelski/graph-coloring-lp/blob/master/Sudoku.py) sets up a given Sudoku puzzle as an integer linear programming formulation and solves it (if a feasible solution exists). As any feasible solution is an optimal solution in the context of the Sudoku problem, the objective function is rather arbitrary.
