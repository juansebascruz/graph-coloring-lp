#An Integer Linear Programming approach to the Graph Coloring Problem and Sudoku Application

__Definition 1:__ A `coloring` of an undirected graph G consists in assigning a number (or a color) to each node, with the restriction that any two nodes that have an edge in between cannot be assigned the same number (or color).

__Definition 2:__ The `chromatic number` of a graph is k âˆˆ N if there exists a coloring that uses k colors, but there is no coloring that uses less than k colors. Thus, the chromatic number is the minimum number of colors needed to have a coloring of a graph.
